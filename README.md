# Data_1202_Assignment_5

In this assignment we will create a GitHub repository and add a python file from previous class lectures.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

It would be easier for any individual to install GitHub Desktop on your local machine to start with and then follow the below mentioned steps

```
Install GitHub for version controlling and Anaconda or VSCode for python scripting
```

### Installing

A step by step guide is attached on the google file [file] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-4uYM1VJNCpmtMFMjLX9PosmXVwEURS4df9DMx6txg/edit) 


```
Follow the document to recreate the library and the python file.
```


## Running the tests
The aim is to create a new local repository in your local machine and then push the items to GitHub

1- Load the libraries
2- Load the dataset salaries
3- Check the total number of rows and columns
4- Check the total elements in the dataset
5- Check all the columns names
6- Check column data types




### Break down into end to end tests

1- Login into the GitHub desktop
2- Create a new repository - "Data_1205_Assignment_5"
3- Open the repository in VSCode or Anaconda (in this case I have used VSCode)
4- Create a new python file in the VSCode - "Week7_Lab3.ipynb" (as I using week 7 Lab exercise)
5- The newly created will be reflected in the GitHub desktop
6- Commit the changes to main branch
7- Publish the repository
8- Open GitHub on your browser and login to your profile and you can see the newly created repository 
9- Ensure all the files are in place
